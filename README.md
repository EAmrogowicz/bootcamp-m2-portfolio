# Unit 2 Challenge: Portfolio

## Description

Build a portfolio page, which you can addjust as the course progresses.

A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to
fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your
strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have
portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are
typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp.

Apply the core skills you've recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS
variables.

## Installation

Follow these instructions to create your project and deploy it to GitHub Pages:

1. Create a new repository on your GitHub account and clone it to your computer.

1. When you're ready to deploy, use the `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`
   commands to save and push your code to your GitHub repository.

1. Navigate to your GitHub repository in the browser and then select the
   Settings tab on the right side of the page.

1. On the Settings page, scroll down to the GitHub Pages section. Then, in the
   section labeled Source, select the `main` branch as your source.

1. Navigate to <your-github-username.github.io/your-repository-name> and you
   will find that your new webpage has gone live! For example, if your GitHub
   username is "lernantino" and the project is "css-demo-site", then your URL
   would be <lernantino.github.io/css-demo-site>.

> **Important**: It might take a few minutes for GitHub pages to display your
> site correctly. If your project does not deploy or display correctly, check
> that all file paths in your application are relative and use the right casing.
> GitHub is case-sensitive, an inccorect capital or lowercase letter could cause
> problems in deployment.

Be sure to add, commit, and push your work to see the most up-to-date version of
your app!

> **Note**: Use the web appearance as a quidance. Feel free to use your own
> colors and images.

## Requirements

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that
satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

- When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar,
  and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
- When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the
  corresponding section
- When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled
  images of your applications
- When presented with the your first application then that application's image
  should be larger in size than the others
- When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that
  deployed application
- When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the
  layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport
